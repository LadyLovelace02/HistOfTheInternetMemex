complex: a system where the whole is seperatable from the individual parts. Has feedback loops that allow the system to recover from damage
	ie a highway
complicated: if one thing breaks the whole thing falls apart
	ie the space shuttle
the internet is a complex system rather than a complicated one it is more than the sum of its parts and has ways to recover from individual failures
