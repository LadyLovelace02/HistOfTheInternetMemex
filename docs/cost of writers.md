{Use this section to think about connections. Think about **how the newly created notes connect with your existing knowledge**. If you find some connections, connect the new notes with the older notes already in your system.To find these, ask:

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
