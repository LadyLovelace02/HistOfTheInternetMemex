The tutorial level is important since it is a step by step guide on how to use [nessisary](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/2.Assessment/Personal%20Memex/) tools for the course such as [obsidian](https://obsidian.md), [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org), and [GitHub](https://github.com). It is also a funny way to enguage the students and give us a better understanding of the course expectations and goals aswell as giving the professor some more info about us and our expectations in the course.
